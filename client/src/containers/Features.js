        <h3>Fast & Reliable</h3>
        <p>
          Built with the extremely fault tolerant technology behind the
          telecom industry, Elixir/Erlang/OTP, Elixium extends blockchain
          fault tolerance while parallelizing blockchain and contract code
          for increased performance.

      <div className="textBlock light centered">
        <img src={ anonymousÂ } alt='Anonymous' />
        <h3>Anonymous</h3>
        <p>
          Using Zero-knowledge Proof of Work and standardized intervalized
          key-swapping, Elixium is able to protect the identity of its users
          by ensuring that they can not be identified by transaction contents
          or patterns.
        </p>

        <h3>Scriptable</h3>
        <p>
          Elixium takes a unique stance on smart contracting -- Elixium is
          language agnostic, smart contracts can be written in any language
          that compiles to WebAssembly, which means developers can use
          their existing toolset rather than learning a new one.
