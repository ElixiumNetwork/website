# The Elixium Network

Replace your tech stack with a decentralized network built to work for you, in a way that works for you.
No more learning new languages to build for the new web.

## Features

- Fast & Reliable
    Built with the extremely fault tolerant technology behind the telecom industry, Elixir/Erlang/OTP,
    Elixium extends blockchain fault tolerance while parallelizing blockchain and contract code for increased performance.
- Private
    Using Zero-knowledge proofs and standardized intervalized key-swapping,
    Elixium is able to protect the identity of its users by ensuring that they can not be identified by transaction contents or patterns.
- Scriptable
    Elixium takes a unique stance on smart contracting - Elixium is language agnostic,
    smart contracts can be written in any language that compiles to WebAssembly, which means developers can use their existing toolset rather than learning a new one.
